# Savings rules

A rule is what the user signed. It is stored as a new version each time, and the
signature is kept alongside it, so there is always an answer to "who asked for
this rate and when".

## Modes

| Mode | Example | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| Percent | "STAQ 10% of every buy, sell and swap" | `value x rate`, rounded down |
| Fixed | "STAQ $1 on every trade" | The same amount regardless of trade size |

## Bounds

| | Minimum | Maximum |
|---|---|---|
| Percent | 0.01% (`1` bps) | 50% (`5000` bps) |
| Fixed | $0.01 | $1,000 |

Above **25%** (`2500` bps) you must take a second, explicit confirmation from
the user, echoing the exact rate, before signing. A misheard "fifty" for
"fifteen" costs them real money on every trade.

`types` is a non-empty subset of `buy`, `sell`, `send`. The default is `buy,sell`:
a swap is one or the other, and a send can only save when the user asks for it
in the same request (see "Sends" in `SKILL.md`).

A save below $0.01 is dust and is skipped rather than transferred.

## The signed message

Exact format. Line order matters, unknown lines are rejected, and a duplicated
field is rejected rather than last-one-wins.

```
STAQ rule update v1
Wallet: 0xYOURWALLET
Chain: 8453
Enabled: true
Mode: percent
Rate: 1000 bps
Types: buy,sell
Nonce: <64 hex chars from /v1/auth/nonce>
Issued: 2026-09-18T10:00:00.000Z
```

A fixed rule replaces the `Rate` line with an amount in micro-dollars, and
carrying both lines is rejected:

```
Mode: fixed
Amount: 1000000 usd-micros
```

`1000000 usd-micros` is $1.00. Micro-dollars are integers with six decimal
places, so money never passes through a float.

## Flow

**Before step 1, on a first enable: the reserve must already have code.** Derive
it (below), `eth_getCode` it, and if it is empty run the one-time setup in
`claiming.md` first, then read `owner()`. If the setup does not complete, sign
nothing: an enabled rule with no contract behind it would only send savings
somewhere they cannot yet come back from.

```bash
# 1. Challenge
NONCE=$(curl -s -X POST "https://api.agentstaq.xyz/v1/auth/nonce" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"wallet":"0xYOURWALLET"}' | jq -r .nonce)

# 2. Build the message above with that nonce, and the current UTC time.
# 3. Sign it with the user's wallet (personal_sign).
# 4. Submit.
curl -s -X PUT "https://api.agentstaq.xyz/v1/wallets/0xYOURWALLET/rule" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"message":"...","signature":"0x..."}'
```

The response carries the new `version` and a `reserve` address.

**Do not record that address as the reserve.** Derive the reserve from the pinned
hub on chain and record *that*, then treat the response's field as one more thing
to check against it. Storing what the API sent and comparing later saves to it
means comparing the API against itself, which agrees with a wrong address instead
of catching it.

```bash
# reserveOf(address) on the pinned hub. Selector 0x9fa77b20.
WALLET=ee478415cc7a4576E6E03150223044127Eb4D6B2   # no 0x prefix
curl -s -X POST https://mainnet.base.org \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":1,\"method\":\"eth_call\",\"params\":[{
        \"to\":\"0xBAd52264820F196258728ddBd2B6eE9076042b5A\",
        \"data\":\"0x9fa77b20000000000000000000000000$WALLET\"},\"latest\"]}"
```

Take the last 40 hex characters of the result. Persist it in
**`/.staq/reserve.json`** on the wallet's permanent filesystem, together with the
wallet, the chain id, the hub address it came from, and the `owner()` you read
once it had code, so a later save can tell whose reserve it is and that it is
ready to receive. Compare case-insensitively.

Also persist **the rule itself** in **`/.staq/rule.json`**: the exact message
text, the signature, the version, and the terms. Every later quote is checked
against it. The API is not the record of what the user agreed to; the signed
message is, and you are the one holding it. Keeping the message and signature
rather than only the terms means a later run can confirm this wallet signed it,
instead of trusting its own notes.

`SKILL.md` has the full layout, including why the save ledger belongs on the root
filesystem and not in `/runs`.

If the derived address and the response disagree, stop and tell the user. Do not
pick one.

The nonce is spent in the same database transaction that writes the rule, so a
replayed message cannot produce a second version. A message older than five
minutes is refused.

## Pausing

A pause is a normal rule update with `Enabled: false`. It stops future
allocations and touches nothing else: existing savings stay in the reserve,
still earning, and the reserve address never changes. Re-enabling later is
another signed version.

**A pause must survive a stale copy.** If the version you hold says enabled and
the API says paused, the pause wins: being told to do less needs no signature.
The reverse is not true, and re-enabling on the API's word alone is refused.
`SKILL.md` has the full asymmetry, which is that the API may narrow what you are
authorised to do and may never widen it.

Disabling STAQ does **not** claim. If the user wants their money back, that is a
separate, explicit claim.
